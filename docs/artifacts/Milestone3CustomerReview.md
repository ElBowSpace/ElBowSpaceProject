# Customer Review

## The Good
* Overall, good job everyone. We're on task, we're on point, and we're on time.
* That being said, the customer feels that we might need more help, so we might have a new intern joining us soon.
* This person should be helping out with the coding typically due to the fact that coding will be increasing in quantity with each milestone.

## Keep Working On
* Overall, make sure that when you change your job positions that you spend time with the person replacing you, so that they understand what you did, and how to
move forward with keeping up the great work. This may be especially necessary due to the fact that we have new people joining us.

### Keep up the good work.
