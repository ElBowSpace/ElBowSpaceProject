### Customer review

* TBD

## ElBow Space - Project Charter

ElBow Space is a social media platform on the web that allows users to store photos,
send messenges to friends, (dis)like and emote on content, and share other web content
at their leisure.  ElBow Space will let users share as much or as little as they like.



### Business proposition

Why do this project?  What is the true benefit?
ElBow Space is meant to help society keep in touch with family and friends, and 
express themselves creatively, while staying comfortably distant in these 
troubled times.


#### Client

Mark Seaman of Shrinking World fame reached out to our team to build an application
that will allow users to easily share their interests with others.

#### Societal Value

Create the most intuitive tool for users to create a personal space that embodies their
unique outlook and varied interests in life. Users will find family and friends and build
a network of support online through our website.

#### Business Value

Lets be real, investors want an alternative to the current leaders in social media and we
intend to give them what they want.

### Project scope & budget

What will we build and how much will it cost?  ElBowSpace will use open source or free 
community and educational software to build, thus the only real cost is the tuition money
spent by the four creators on the degree through which this project is supported.  In 
addition there is an appreciable quantity of time spent through a 4-5 month development 
cycle.


#### Schedule, Money, Features

There are three primary priorities that define the scope of a software project.  It is 
important to establish the priority of each of these.  

#### ElBowSpace Priorities

1. Schedule - This project must be completed by December 4, 2020 to be fairly graded.
2. Money - This project will be the collaborative work of students so no actual money will
be spent.  However, the budget can be measured in opportunity costs.  This project will
require about an unknown quantity of hours.  We are still learning to estimate this.  We
might assume however that, as our instructor, with his vast experience, has estimated he will 
spend at least a hundred hours on his book builder app, its not unreasonable to anticipate we
might spend four times as much time equating to at least 400 hours.
Our time is valued according to Glassdoor.com at $36/hour, making the project budget $14,400.
3. Features - Three tiers of features will be defined. Essential features define the 
Minimum Viable Product. Required features mark the Minimum Desirable Project.  Desired 
features define the Luxury Project.

Note the priorities - Schedule will never move, and Money will move only to protect 
the schedule.  Features will be adjusted throughout the milestone and must be constantly
negotiated with the client.

#### Project Features
##### Client Requested Features
* Simple App - settings, urls, views, templates
* Multi-view App - data insertion, view inheritance, includes
* Data Models - data model list, admin views, superuser
* List Files - table formatter, links, add view, list view
* CRUD App - details content, links, update, delete
* Automated Test - design reviews
* Notes App - data model, CRUD views

#### Deliverable Features
* User generated account with secure login credentials required
* User created text field to carry a story
* User uploaded photos
* User can add friends to their network, as well as unfriend
* Connected users can reply to stories and photos creating a thread related to the entry
* Users can apply emotes to individual entries
* Users can search connected users network to make new connections

##### User Experience

A user creates an account.  They can upload an image to facilitate telling a story.  Their
network of friends and family can like, share, or comment on the thread that the user started.
Sharing a thread creates a new subthread that expands the reach of the story to new networks.
Users can also simply write into a text box to make a new thread.

### Our Team

#### Development Team

No great works of software are a solo effort.

* Ben McEwen - Requirements Lead, Client Advocate
* Kevin Ritter - Dev Ops Lead Software Engineer
* Stephen Provost - Chief Design Engineer
* Angel Rivera - Senior Test Engineer

Each person is given a role that matches their expertise. For each Milestone developers will
commit to the features that they can realistically accomplish in the two-week 
Development Sprint.

#### Communication Plan

The dev team will meet MWF each week before class at 12:00-12:20PM to coordinate 
project activities.  Development work will be done outside of this meeting.
This will serve the purpose of the "Scrum Daily Stand-up Meeting".

#### Meeting Agenda

Project coordination meetings will occur virtually over Discord on a private server.
The team will meet weekly from 12:00-1:00PM MDT on Thursday for project coordination.

In this coordination each member will answer three questions.

* What did I do?
* What am I working on next?
* What challenges or risks are before me?

This meeting is for coordination only.  Developers should follow up and collaborate
later with each other when they see opportunities.

#### Team Coordination

Person in requirements role will lead the meetings as "Scrum Master".  Mark Seaman will represent the
client interests to clarify the requirements.


### Scrum

Milestones

1. Project Plan Complete
2. Technology Proven
3. Core Features Implemented
4. Functionality Complete

7. First Upgrade

#### Lifecycle

* Requirements - lead during Milestones 1-3
* Design - lead during Milestones 2-4
* Code - lead during Milestones 3-5
* Test  - lead during Milestones 5-7

#### Sprints

Each milestone represents a development sprint, which will be a highly focused burst 
of energy to meet the milestone goals.  Each sprint will last for two weeks.

During the Sprint developers will be building the next version of the product.  They will
be working on an explicit list of features designated by the client.  All other activities
will be postponed until the Sprint is complete.  Features that are planned cannot change 
during the Sprint.

#### Sprint Planning meetings

Each Sprint will start with a Sprint Planning Meeting (Mondays).  Development team will meet with 
the client to determine the client features with the highest priority.  This will be 
expressed as a Product Backlog which shows the features in sorted order of importance to 
the client.

For each Milestone developers will commit to the features that they can realistically accomplish in 
the two-week development Sprint.  Features are selected by the individual developer and must include 
the highest priority issues on the Product Backlog.

If a developer cannot deliver the required functionality then another teammate will be 
required to produce the missing result.

#### Team Survey

After each milestone team members will give feedback about the team dynamics they
experienced. A brief survey will show how the team is working together.  The results of this 
survey will be recorded as a part of the public record for ElBow Space.  

Each team member is required to complete the survey for each milestone.  Tools will act as
a reminder.
