## Elbow Space - Version control

All code for Elbow Space lives in git repos at Github. This includes the application 
source code, the documents for development, and the customer website used for marketing, 
which will be developed as the application takes shape.
Github also houses all of the project management team documentation that was created during
the project development cycle: wiki, issues, project kanban, and instant messages.

Github will be the universe in which Elbow Space takes place: leaving plenty of room for everyone to get their own personal bubble.


### Setup Github account

Elbow Space is its own github account, a master account, setup at github.com/ElBowSpace/; all of the members working on it are considered "Collaborators" to 
best ensure that any work that is being performed on the project will meet peer-review standards set by the team. This way, all work done will be a team effort.


### Setup Github Pages repository

Github Pages will provide an automatic website that can be viewed by the Book Builder 
end-users and potential customers.  Like all web apps Elbow Space needs to have a website
for marketing and training.

The Elbow Space client website will be built so that the automatic publishing of 
Github Pages will make it publicly available.
A "Elbow Space" directory will be used to hold the documents for the website.

The client's website will be hosted on PythonAnywhere, partially due to his familiarity with it, and also due to the cost benefits present.


### Decide how to publish your project docs

Documents are written for communication within the team and to keep the client updated.
The documents will be available directly through the Github repository.  This will limit
the document visibility to the same people that have permissions to the code repository.

The [Github Repo](https://github.com/ElBowSpace/ElBowSpaceProject)
holds the 
[Elbow Space Documents](https://github.com/ElBowSpace/ElBowSpaceProject/tree/master/docs)

### User Guide for Development Workflow

The requirements for project development will be relatively simple: every collaborator will be able to work on a clone of the master file,
and then are able to push their changes to the server. This change is not immediately accepted, but rather needs to be approved by one other
member of the group before it will be merged with the master file.

There is a "master" account, but access to it will be restricted to times where the entire group agrees that accessing it is necessary.
